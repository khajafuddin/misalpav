========================================================

1. New requirement --  Dockerfile -- Images -- Containers (Automate)
    Bare Metal machine
        can't containerise
          plan the retirement
          start from scratch  -- Dockerfile-Images-Containers
Refactor -- Modify the code as per requirement -- Dockerfile -- images- containers
2. Virtual machine --
  can't containerise
  plan the retirement
  start from scratch -- Dockerfile-Images-Containers
  move VM as container in k8s
  Refactor -- Modify the code as per requirement -- Dockerfile -- images- containers
3. Containers
  move containers as it is
  data (Internal Volume / External Volume)
  COnfiguration
